JAGS scripts for seven cognitive models, and three contaminant models. The cognitive models are in two forms, using either the error-of-execution or probit decision rule. These provide the parameter estimates and descriptive adequacies.

The latent-mixture model JAGS scripts are also provided, one for each decision rule. These provide the inferences about participants' model use.
